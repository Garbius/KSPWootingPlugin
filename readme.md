# Wooting Support for Kerbal Space Program

This is a plugin for Kerbal Space Program that allows analog control of your rockets, space ships, airplanes, and rovers. The controls are configured in the game settings menu as regular key binds. It does not use axis inputs so it can work in conjunction with a joystick, which can be quite useful to get a completely analog 6DOF. 

## Installation

Extract the WootingPlugin folder into your `Kerbal Space Program\GameData` directory. This plugin requires Harmony. A community maintained version can be found at https://github.com/KSPModdingLibs/HarmonyKSP/releases and it is also available on CKAN.

## Support

I can be found in the Wooting Discord server if you're having any issues. If it looks like a bug, please open an issue on the GitHub page or create a pull request if you can fix it on your own.
